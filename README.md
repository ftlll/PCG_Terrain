# Procedural Terrain Generation with Perlin Noise

This project demonstrates procedural generation of synthetic terrain in **Unity** with **C#** script.  
It combines **multi-band Perlin noise** for realistic height variation, **texture mapping** for color, **dynamic terrain streaming** as the camera moves, and **simple procedural vegetation** to enhance the environment.

The project can simulate a variety of landscapes such as deserts, mountain ranges, alien worlds, underwater seascapes, or islands.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Multi-band Perlin Noise Terrain**
  - Uses at least **three different Perlin noise bands** (low, medium, and high frequency) to create realistic terrain with fractal-like variations.
  - Terrain mesh is a high-resolution grid (e.g., **85Ã—85 squares per chunk**, within Unityâ€™s 16,384-vertex limit).
  - Elevation generated by adjusting vertex `Y` positions.

- **Seamless Tiled Terrain**
  - World extends infinitely by **generating new chunks on demand** as the camera moves.
  - Adjacent chunks align seamlessly by using **world-space coordinates** for noise sampling.
  - Surface normals at seams are calculated to ensure **smooth shading without visible edges**.

- **Texture-Based Coloring**
  - Terrain colored using one or more **texture maps**.
  - UV coordinates assigned to each mesh vertex.
  - Height-based and noise-based color variations for more natural appearance.

- **Simple Vegetation**
  - Placed very simple plants (â‰¤ 6 Unity primitives per plant) randomly across the terrain.
  - Plant density, color, and size can vary by terrain features (e.g., more vegetation in valleys).

- **Camera-Driven Streaming**
  - Dynamically generates new terrain chunks as the camera moves close to existing edges.
  - removes distant terrain chunks to save memory.

- **Procedural Rock/Rubble Piles**
  - Uses scripts to spawn simple rock shapes (squashed spheres/cylinders) above the ground.
  - Applies Unity **Rigidbody** physics to let them fall naturally into piles at specific locations.

- **First-Person and Thrid-Person Mode**
  - Enables player to move across terrain using **WASD controls**.
  - Allows immersive exploration of generated worlds.
